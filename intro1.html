    <!-- Coding is just writing. Movies make it seem crazy, but really all you're doing is typing. You write a lot of plain-text, like this, and the computer knows how to read it. For example, this is a comment. Your browser knows this is a comment because of the arrow characters that surround it. Comments don't show up, they're just for you and other developers. -->

        <!-- Where does this title appear? -->
        <title>Baylee's #thanksgving site</title>

        <!-- As we just went over, HTML is a language for structure. CSS is a language for styling, and JavaScript is a programming language we will use to add interaction. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are standardized and can be used across browsers. They are the three main pieces of front-end web development, and we'll cover all three this weekend. -->

        <!-- TODO: Add the style.css stylesheet to this page. You'll know it worked when your page turns blue. Make sure to save this file and refresh the page in your browser to see changes. Hint: google 'add css to html' -->

    <!-- HTML is a language for structure. You're not really telling the computer to DO anything, you're just describing objects to it. We use these <tags> to do that. For example, we are telling the browser that the main body of our web page lives here, between the <body> and </body> tags. -->

        <!-- <h1> stands for Heading 1. How many other headings are there? -->

            <p>This weekend we'll be working on a Thanksgiving-themed site that uses the Instagram API. There's no expectation that anyone here has done any web development work before--you can be a complete newbie.</p>
            <p>Some things to keep in mind this weekend:</p>
            <!-- <ul> is an Unordered List. <li>s are the List Items inside. What's an unordered list? Well, change the <ul> and </ul> to <ol> and </ol> for an Ordered List. How does the page change when you save and refresh? -->
            <ul>
                <li>Don't get worried if it takes you awhile to figure something out, and don't be afraid to just start typing. Writing code isn't about "knowing the answer"--it's problem-solving, and you often have to just bang your head against it for awhile before it makes sense.</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help. The whole point of this workshop is to work with beginners.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our goals for this weekend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exposure to web development</li>
                <li>Working examples to refer to later on your own</li>
                <li>Experience Googling answers</li>
                <li>Something cool to show off :)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <!-- TODO: Make a new heading with your name. Make a smaller heading below it that says 'My favorite things'. Then add an ordered or unordered list of some of your favorite things. -->

            <!-- TODO: Bonus! Add an <img> of yourself in this section. -->
